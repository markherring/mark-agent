## Answer (STAR Format)

### Core Philosophy
Let me first start by saying that ABM is not the solution to everything. But it does focus you and your sales team on creating revenue. The trap I see is companies treating ABM as a program you bolt on. It's not a program — it's a way of operating. It starts with knowing your customer, focusing your resources, and being willing to say no to accounts that don't fit.

### Situation: Figuring Out Where the Revenue Actually Comes From
At HiveMQ, we were spreading ourselves thin — trying to be relevant to every industry, every use case. So I sat down with RevOps and the CRO and we analyzed where revenue was actually coming from. Turns out roughly 80% of our revenue came from four verticals — manufacturing, automotive, energy, and logistics. That's not a marketing insight, that's a business insight. But marketing is where it gets operationalized.

I've seen the same dynamic play out at InfluxData, where we had to figure out which use cases (IoT, observability, real-time analytics) were actually driving enterprise deals versus just developer adoption. And at Hortonworks, where the open-source community was massive but the enterprise revenue was concentrated in specific industries.

### Task: Turn That Insight Into a Focused GTM Motion
The challenge is always the same — you've got data showing where the revenue concentrates, but the organization wants to keep all doors open. Sales reps have accounts they don't want to give up. The CEO has a pet vertical. Someone on the board knows a buyer at a company that doesn't fit the ICP at all. The task is to build the analytical case, get alignment, and then actually commit — which means saying no to some accounts and some opportunities.

### Action: How I Build and Run ABM

**Step 1: ICP and Vertical Analysis**
Start with the data. Work with RevOps and sales leadership to analyze where revenue, pipeline, and win rates actually concentrate. Cut the book by vertical, company size, and use case. This isn't a marketing exercise — it's a joint exercise with the CRO and RevOps. If sales doesn't co-own the target list, the whole thing falls apart.

**Step 2: Cut the Book and Tier the Accounts**
Once we've identified the target verticals, we tier accounts — P1 through P4. P1 accounts get the most resources, the most personalized content, the most SDR attention. P4 accounts get lighter-touch, more programmatic coverage. This is where the hard conversations happen — some reps push back because they've got accounts outside the target verticals they believe in. You have to manage that. I handle it by showing the data, being direct about where we're placing bets, and being open that we'll revisit the list quarterly based on results. But the commitment has to hold or the whole thing dissolves into opportunism.

**Step 3: Build Vertical-Specific Content and Campaigns**
We created separate playbooks for each priority vertical — white papers, data sheets, case studies, presentations, landing pages, all tailored to that vertical's language, pain points, and buying triggers. Generic content doesn't work in ABM. If you're going after automotive, you need to speak to automotive problems with automotive proof points.

**Step 4: Run Two Distinct Motions — New Accounts and Expansion**
This is important — I run new account ABM and expansion ABM as separate campaigns with separate playbooks. New account ABM is about getting in the door — awareness, credibility, first meetings. Expansion ABM is about growing inside accounts you've already won. There's often more revenue in expansion than people realize, and it requires different messaging (you're talking to users and champions, not introducing yourself). At HiveMQ, the expansion motion was critical to scaling revenue and improving net retention.

**Step 5: Intent Data and Enrichment**
Layer in tools like 6sense or Demandbase for intent signals — who's researching your category, who's spiking on competitor content. Use Clay for enrichment to build richer account profiles and personalize outreach. Feed intent signals to SDRs so they're reaching out when accounts are actively in-market, not cold.

**Step 6: Dedicated SDR Coverage**
ABM without dedicated SDR coverage is just content marketing with a target list. I assign SDRs to ABM accounts specifically — they own the outbound motion into those accounts, they know the vertical, and they're measured on meetings set within the target list. At HiveMQ, this drove 50%+ outbound pipeline growth. At InfluxData, I built the SDR org from 0 to 12 and the outbound contribution to pipeline became a material part of the revenue engine.

**Step 7: Relentless Focus on the Messages**
Once you have the verticals, the content, and the accounts — you relentlessly send focused messages to key contacts in those accounts. Not one email blast. Sustained, multi-touch, multi-channel sequences that reinforce the same positioning. And you hold the messaging for at least 18 months. The temptation is always to change the message after a quarter because it "feels stale." It's not stale — it's just starting to land.

### Result: What This Produces
At HiveMQ, the vertical-focused ABM approach was a key part of how we more than doubled qualified pipeline from $25M to $53M (+112%) and increased marketing-sourced pipeline from €15.6M to €21.7M (+39%). Marketing's contribution to closed-won revenue went from 23% to 31%. The expansion ABM motion was central to scaling revenue from $10M to $30M+.

At InfluxData, the combination of ICP clarity, vertical focus, and a scaled SDR org (0 to 12 reps) helped drive pipeline from $5.5M to ~$9M per quarter and improved beginning-of-quarter forecast coverage from 2.4× to 5.1×. ABM gave us the focus to grow ARR from $1M to $30M — it wasn't the only thing, but it was the backbone of how we prioritized.

The pattern is consistent — ABM works when it's built on data, co-owned with sales, supported by dedicated SDRs, and held with discipline over time. It doesn't work when it's a side project or when the target list changes every quarter.
