## Answer (STAR Format)

### Core Story
I actually started my career as a programmer — I have a mathematics degree and I wrote code professionally before moving into marketing. So the technical foundation isn't something I had to fake or bolt on later. It's where I started. Over 30+ years I've moved further from writing code and closer to translating technical depth into business outcomes, but that engineering mindset never left. I still think in systems, I still read technical documentation, and I still want to understand how things actually work before I try to market them.

### How Technical Fluency Shows Up in Practice

At **Oracle and Sun Microsystems**, I was marketing the Java platform to a developer ecosystem that grew to 12 million monthly users. You can't be credible with CTOs and senior engineers if you're hand-waving past how the platform actually works. I earned trust with those audiences because I could have real conversations about architecture and trade-offs — not because I was writing Java, but because I understood the engineering decisions developers were making and why they mattered.

At **InfluxData**, understanding how time-series databases handle data ingestion and query performance at scale was the difference between marketing to DevOps engineers and marketing past them. When your buyer is monitoring 100,000 servers, they'll test your knowledge in the first conversation. That technical fluency shaped everything — from how we positioned InfluxDB against competitors to how we built the content engine that drove developer adoption and ultimately $30M in ARR.

At **HiveMQ**, selling into manufacturing and industrial automation meant the buyers were often engineers themselves. Understanding MQTT, message routing under load, and industrial integration patterns wasn't optional — it was the price of entry. That depth let me build vertical GTM plays that actually resonated with the technical champions inside those accounts, which was central to doubling qualified pipeline from $25M to $53M.

At **Teleport**, the buyers were security engineers evaluating infrastructure access platforms. Security buyers are incredibly technical — they'll test your knowledge in the first five minutes. Being able to discuss zero-trust architecture and how Teleport's approach was technically differentiated gave our positioning credibility that no amount of marketing polish could have created on its own.

### The AI Tooling Layer
Here's where it gets interesting right now. I'm not just marketing AI products — I'm actively building with AI tools in my own marketing practice. I use **Claude and ChatGPT** daily for content, analysis, and strategic thinking. I use **Clay** for data enrichment and prospecting automation. I use **N8N** for workflow orchestration. I use **Tofu AI** for content personalization. I'm building agentic workflows that automate targeting, lifecycle engagement, and GTM execution.

This isn't theoretical for me. I'm a CMO who actually operates with AI tooling, not one who talks about it in decks. That hands-on experience means I understand what agentic AI can actually do in production — the capabilities, the limitations, and where the real value is. That perspective shapes how I think about positioning and how I talk to technical buyers.

### The Translation Layer
Here's what I've learned across all of these: **you don't need to write the code, but you need to understand the problems the code solves.** I can have a technical conversation with a solutions architect about data streaming or message persistence or agent orchestration. I can read technical documentation and understand the trade-offs. I can sit in a product review and ask the right questions.

But the real value is in **translation**. The customer doesn't buy your routing engine — they buy intelligent routing that reduces escalations by 40%. They don't buy your three-tier architecture — they buy agents that actually remember context and get smarter over time. That translation layer — from technical capability to business outcome — that's where I live. And you can only do it well if you actually understand the technology underneath.
