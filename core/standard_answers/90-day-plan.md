## Mark's Answer

**Here are the three key areas I'd focus on, in priority order:**

### 1. Brand/Positioning - "Who we are and why we exist"

Before I do anything else, I need to get alignment on positioning and messaging. At every company I've joined - Twingate, Gravitational, InfluxData - this has been the foundation everything else builds on.

The framework I use:
- **Brand foundation:** Vision, Mission, Values, Personality (VMVP)
- **What our brand stands for:** Our values and how we show up
- **Visual identity:** Brand colors, fonts - this matters more than people think for standing out in noisy markets
- **Positioning:** What's different about us? What unique benefits do we deliver?
- **Messaging:** How do we connect brand, product, and audience into public-facing messages?

This isn't a quick exercise. The process takes 12 weeks, and you often need external vendors to help facilitate it. Once you commit to new positioning, you hold it for 18 months minimum. The biggest mistake companies make is changing messaging every quarter when it "feels stale." The market hasn't heard it yet.

**Real examples:**
- At **Hortonworks**, we went with "Big Data" as the brand category because that's what Gartner called it. Was it a great name? No. But Gartner is the thousand-pound gorilla, and we needed exec alignment. Sometimes you adopt the market language even when it's not perfect.
- At **Gravitational**, they had two products - Gravitational and Teleport. The interesting challenge was focusing on Teleport, the product with more revenue potential, and essentially repositioning the company around the second product. That's a hard pivot but sometimes necessary.
- At **HiveMQ**, we chose bold yellow as our brand color. Not subtle, but it made us stand out. Same with T-Mobile's bright fuchsia. I'm not the "fluffy marketing guy," but in crowded markets, distinctive visual identity matters.

### 2. Content and Awareness

Content is king, but marketing doesn't write all of it. I need strong technical content from engineers, strong point of view from founders, and customer testimonials from sales and customer success.

Marketing's role:
- Keep the content engine working (the "coach")
- Amplify the message
- Own the editorial calendar
- **Own the narrative** - get our POV out there consistently
- Rework testimonials into persona-based content
- BUT WE DON'T WRITE ALL THE CONTENT

I'm not looking for a team of content writers. I'm looking for someone who can get the real subject matter experts - engineers, founders, customers - to create authentic content. If you fake technical expertise, your buyers will know immediately.

This also includes PR/AR, internal communications (getting employees talking about us on LinkedIn), and investing in awareness through **SEO and GPT-based engine optimization** (optimizing for AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity), events, paid search with killer landing pages, and nurture programs.

### 3. Pipeline and Tooling

Goal: Generate qualified pipeline. The funnel is: Inquiries/MQLs/PQLs → Meetings → Opportunities → Revenue.

This means:
- **Assess and strengthen Demand Generation leadership** - If you don't have a strong Demand Gen leader, hire one. If you do, make sure they have the resources and authority to fix operational problems like pipeline handoffs, lead follow-up, and SDR/BDR team management. Many pipeline problems are operational (leads sitting untouched, broken handoffs) not strategic.
- **Invest in the modern martech stack:**
  - **Clay** - data enrichment and prospecting (the new kids in town)
  - **Octave HQ** - ICP analysis, works with Clay, much faster
  - **N8N** - building and automating multi-step workflows
  - **Lovable** - AI coding for marketing (vibe coding)
  - **Agentic tools** - Claude, Agent Press, or similar for workflow automation
  - **Glean** - for larger companies with lots of internal content, can create agents
  - **Hockey Stack** - product usage data, product signals, creating PQLs
  - **HubSpot, Salesforce, Gong, Outreach** - core CRM and sales enablement stack
- **Define PLG vs Direct goals** - if you're running a hybrid motion, stop the channel conflict. Set specific goals for each motion and measure them separately.
- **Build ABM muscle** - hyper-targeted ABM into P1-P4 accounts, not opportunistic spray-and-pray

Every company's pipeline problem is different, but the solution is always the same: hire the right demand gen leader, give them the modern tools, and set clear goals.

**ABM (Account-Based Marketing):** Hyper-targeted ABM into P1-P4 accounts, not opportunistic spray-and-pray. This is how you execute pipeline generation into target accounts - tight alignment between marketing and sales, account-specific campaigns, using Clay + Octave HQ for research.

## How This Maps to 30/60/90 Days

**First 30 Days: Diagnostic**
- Meet with every stakeholder (founders, sales, product, customer success, board)
- Customer and prospect interviews
- Competitive analysis
- Review all funnel metrics, conversion rates, pipeline data
- Assess current marketing team and capabilities
- Deliverable: Initial observations (what's working, what's not) and proposed priorities

**Days 30-60: Build the Foundation**
- Start positioning/messaging work (enlist external help if needed)
- Begin persona development (survey customers, interview prospects)
- Define ICP and segmentation
- Start hiring process for key roles (Demand Gen, Content Orchestrator)
- Begin content calendar planning
- Deliverable: Positioning framework v1, persona drafts, hiring plan

**Days 60-90: Begin Execution**
- Finalize positioning and messaging (get exec/board sign-off)
- Roll out new messaging framework (website, pitch decks, sales enablement)
- Launch first content initiatives (customer stories, technical blog posts, founder POV pieces)
- Start demand gen programs (if Demand Gen leader is hired, or fractional in the meantime)
- Invest in martech stack improvements
- Deliverable: New messaging live, content engine launched, demand gen roadmap in place

## Key Principles

**Positioning is not a quick fix.** It takes 12 weeks to do properly. You need external help, you need founder commitment, and you need to hold the line for 18 months once it's done.

**Content must be authentic.** Technical buyers can smell fake expertise. Get engineers, founders, and customers to create the content. Marketing amplifies and orchestrates.

**Pipeline requires the right people and tools.** You can't scale demand gen without a great Demand Gen Leader and the right martech stack.

**Everything connects.** Brand → Content → Pipeline → Revenue. These aren't separate functions, they're parts of one system.

## Company-Specific Examples

**For PLG + Enterprise hybrid companies (like Descript, InfluxData):**
First 30 days includes deep analysis of PLG funnel conversion rates, PQL definition, and how hand-raisers convert vs outbound-sourced opps. The positioning work needs to address both the self-serve buyer and the enterprise buyer - they're often different personas.

**For companies with strong analyst recognition (like Kore.ai):**
The positioning work should LEAD with analyst validation. If you're a Gartner Leader or Forrester Leader, that should be the first thing on your website. I'd spend time in the first 30 days understanding why that recognition isn't more visible.

**For companies in noisy markets (like Zero Trust, AI agents):**
The positioning exercise needs to answer: "What problem brings buyers to us?" Not just "what do we do" but "when does someone need us?" If you have a log problem you use Splunk, if you have a search problem you use Elastic. What's YOUR problem statement?

**For technical infrastructure companies (like Teleport, HiveMQ):**
Content strategy has to focus on deep technical content from engineers. No fluff, no generic blog posts. The champion persona needs to see that you understand their world deeply. Marketing's job is to orchestrate, not write.

**For companies considering product pivots or multi-product focus:**
Sometimes the right move is focusing on the product with more revenue potential, even if it's not the original flagship. At Gravitational, this meant pivoting focus to Teleport. The positioning work needs to support that strategic product decision.
